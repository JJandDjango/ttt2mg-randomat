# ttt2mg-randomat
This is a port of the Randomat/Randomat 2.0 addons for TTT2 using the TTT2 Minigames system.

# Minigames

All the minigames here are based on those from the [Randomat 2.0](https://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=1406495040), [Owningle's Extra Randomat Events](https://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=2214440295), or from other Randomat events I've seen in various let's player's TTT videos (sorry I can't point to specific mods, there are so many Randomats). There are some places where I've borrowed code from the original, but by and large I've rebuilt its events using the original as a guideline. Wherever possible, I've tried to incorporate TTT2's improved functions/features.

# Other features

## Randomat Weapon moved to [TTT-2/ttt2mg-randomat](https://github.com/TTT-2/ttt2mg-randomat)

Known Bugs / TODO:
* The icon and model require the old randomat to be installed since I haven't made my own.
* Add sound effects
* Add randomat-like functionality to minigames (where events like "Get Down Mr. President" target the owner of the Randomat specifically) if I can figure out a somewhat elegant solution
